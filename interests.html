        <ol>
            <li>
                My favourite book series is Percy Jackson. My favourite book in that series is Percy Jackson and the Lightning
                Thief. It has an engaging plot mixed with action, comedy, and drama. I recommend reading it if you haven't read it yet.
            </li>
            <li>
                My favourite Sport is basketball. It is a game where two teams of five go against each other to score in their hoop while
                defending the opposing team from scoring.
            </li>
            <li>
                My favourite Place is Las Vegas. I went there for a two-week vacation to visit my grandparent. It was a wild experience
                with lots of drinks and partying.
            </li>
            <li>
                My favourite Food is Adobo. Adobo is a Filipino dish that consists of chicken, garlic, salt, onion, vinegar, soy sauce.
                It is a tasty dish that can go along with any other dishes.
