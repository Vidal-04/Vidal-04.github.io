            Currently, I am motivated to graduating in the Bachelor's of Applied Computer Science. I am unsure on what I will do after
            I graduate but I know for a fact that I am interested in this course. The Bachelor's of Applied Computer Science Courses
            will teach me multiple skills including: problem-solving, communication, and management skills that will go along with my
            deep understanding in technology. Some of these careers are: security analyst, web developer, and game developer.
            The career that I am interested in is being a game developer.

            Currently, I am using two game development engines/softwares, Unity and Roblox. Unity is a complex game engine that
            provides simple yet realistic graphics. Unity gives game developers a 2D or 3D platform to create games. The reason
            why Unity is pleasant to use is because it gives models created by game designers to be used. <br />

        </p>
        <p>
            Another game engine that I use is Roblox. Roblox is an app that allows users to play and create games. I have played this game
            for the past 8 years but now, I am more interested in making games for people to enjoy. Here is a photo of a pirate
            game being created in Roblox Studio: <br />
